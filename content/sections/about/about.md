Born and raised on the small island of Guam 🏝️, I’ve always have been drawn to problem-solving. I spend my days writing code, working with data, and figuring out how to turn abstract ideas into practical solutions.

I work with tools like Python, Java, and SQL, and I enjoy the challenge of creating efficient systems that do exactly what they need to—nothing more, nothing less. From tuning machine learning models to optimizing code, I’m always looking for ways to improve and refine my craft.

Outside of work, I’m constantly tinkering—whether that’s exploring a new field or learning something completely unrelated to tech. For me, every project is an opportunity to grow, and I approach each one with a mindset of learning-by-doing. Whether it’s data or software, I’m always up for the challenge.
